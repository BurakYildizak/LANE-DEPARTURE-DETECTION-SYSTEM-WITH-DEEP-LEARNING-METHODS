# LANE-DEPARTURE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING-METHODS
The biggest causes of road accidents are due to the carelessness and fatigue
of drivers. Uncontrolled lane changes cause accidents. In this study, lane departure
detection by deep learning methods was studied

Deep learning based CNN model was used for lane detection. The midpoint of the
lanes was found. Classification was made using the midpoint changes in lane changes.
Classification was done using ResNet and LSTM-CNN methods. ResNeTâ€™s
performance percentage and sensitivity are higher in the proecss result.
